# Crystal Collector Game

A fun crystal interactive game.

## Here's How The App Works

There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.

   ** The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.
   ** A random number shown at the start of the game should be between 19 - 120.

Each crystal will hold have a random hidden value between 1 - 12.

When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. 

  * The game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal.
  * Once the user clicks one, update the player's score counter.

The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

  * When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.

  * The app will show the number of games the player wins and loses. If the player refreshes the page then the winning and losing score with reset to 0.
